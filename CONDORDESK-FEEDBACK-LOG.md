## 2026-03-18 14:00 — Phase 1 Build In Progress

**Status:** Herbie is building the insights engine, test infrastructure, and wiring it into the app. Multiple integration issues being worked through (missing imports, duplicate code blocks, npm install race condition).

**Files in progress (not yet committed):**
- `PROJECT-PLAN.md` — roadmap (reviewed, feedback in CONDORDESK-PLAN-REVIEW.md)
- `server/src/services/insight-engine.ts` — scoring/insights engine
- `server/src/routes/insights.ts` — `/api/insights` endpoint
- `server/src/types/insight.ts` — type definitions
- `server/test/` — test directory with vitest + supertest
- `server/src/middleware/webhook-auth.ts` — fixed frozen secret bug
- `server/src/index.ts` — integrated insights route
- `.github/workflows/build-win.yml` — adding test step to CI
- `server/package.json` — added vitest, supertest, test scripts

**Feedback:**

1. **Good:** Test infrastructure first is the right call. Vitest + supertest is a clean choice.

2. **Good:** Fixing the webhook auth frozen secret — same class of bug as the static root issue. Module-level evaluation in esbuild bundles is a recurring trap.

3. **Watch out:** Make sure `server/src/index.ts` doesn't have duplicate `export default app;` blocks. A duplicate was spotted earlier — confirm it's cleaned up before committing.

4. **Watch out:** The insights route import in `index.ts` needs to be added BEFORE the static file middleware mount in `startServer()`, not after. Express processes routes in order — if the SPA catch-all `*` handler fires first, `/api/insights` will never be reached.

5. **Reminder:** Read CONDORDESK-PLAN-REVIEW.md if you haven't yet — 7 gaps in the project plan that should be addressed. Most critical: decide on market data source NOW.

6. **Before committing:** Run `npm run build` (not just tests) to make sure the esbuild bundle still works. The last three bugs were all bundle-specific issues that tests alone wouldn't catch.
